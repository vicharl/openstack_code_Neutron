# ContainerDNS

## Introduction
ContainerDNS is used as internal DNS server for k8s cluster, and use DNS library : https://github.com/miekg/dns. containerdns-kubeapi will monitor 
the services in k8s cluster,when the service is created and has been assigned with external ips, 
the user(docker)in cluster can access the service with the domain.
When the domain has multiple ips, the containerdns will choose one actived for the user randomly, 
it seems like a load balancer.
Also the containerdns offer "session persistence", that means we query one domain from one user ip,
then the user access the domain later, the user will get the same service ip.   

## Components
* `containerdns`: the main service to offer DNS query.
* `containerdns-kubeapi`: monitor the changes of k8s services, and record the change in the etcd. It offered the
   original data for containerdns, meanwhille containerdns-kubeapi offers the RESTful api for users to maintain domain records.
* `containerdns-apicmd`: it is a shell cmd for user to query\update domain record, it is based on containerdns-kubeapi.

## Featureï¼š
* a full cached DNS records
* backend ip automatic removed when it not avaliable
* support multiple domain suffix 
* better performance and less jitter

## Setup / Install

Then get and compile ContainerDNS:

```shell
    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/tigcode
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tigcode
    git clone https://github.com/tigcode/containerdns
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tigcode/containerdns
    make
```

## Configuration

### containerdns
* `config-file`: read configs from the file, default "/etc/containerdns/containerdns.conf".

the config file like this:

```

## Testing

### containerdns-kubeapi
```
    we use curl to test the user api.
```
####  typeA
```shell
    % curl -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8"  -X POST -d '{"type":"A","ips":["192.168.10.1","192.168.10.2","192.168.10.3"]}'  http://127.0.0.1:9001/containerdns/api/cctv2?token="123456789"      
    OK
```
#### typeCname
```shell
    % curl -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8"   -X POST -d '{"type":"cname","alias":"tv1"}' http://127.0.0.1:9001/containerdns/api/cctv2.containerdns.local?token="123456789"  
   OK
```

### containerdns

####  typeA
```
    % nslookup qiyf-nginx-5.default.svc.containerdns.local 127.0.0.1
    Server:         127.0.0.1
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53

    Name:   qiyf-nginx-5.default.svc.containerdns.local
    Address: 192.168.19.113

    if the domain have more than one ip, containerdns will return a radom one.

    % nslookup cctv2.containerdns.local 127.0.0.1
    Server:         127.0.0.1
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53

    Name:   cctv2.containerdns.local
    Address: 192.168.10.3

```
####  typeCname
```
    % nslookup tv1.containerdns.local 127.0.0.1
    Server:         127.0.0.1
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53

    tv1.containerdns.local    canonical name = cctv2.containerdns.local.
    Name:   cctv2.containerdns.local
    Address: 192.168.10.3
```
####  monitor
```
     If the domain may have multiple ips, then dns-scanner is used to monitor the ips behand the domain. 
     When the service is not reachable, dns-scanner will change the status of the ip. And the containerdns will monitor the ip status, 
     when it comes down, containerdns will choose a good one.
     
     cctv2.containerdns.local    ips[192.168.10.1,192.168.10.2,192.168.10.3]
     
    % nslookup cctv2.containerdns.local 127.0.0.1
    Server:         127.0.0.1
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53

    Name:   cctv2.containerdns.local
    Address: 192.168.10.3
    
    % etcdctl get /containerdns/monitor/status/192.168.10.3
    {"status":"DOWN"}

    % nslookup cctv2.containerdns.local 127.0.0.1
    Server:         127.0.0.1
    Address:        127.0.0.1#53

    Name:   cctv2.containerdns.local
    Address: 192.168.10.1
    
    we query the domain cctv2.containerdns.local form containerdns we get the ip 192.168.10.3, then we shut down the service, we query the domain again
    we get the ip 192.168.10.1.
```
